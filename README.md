## Setup

1. Open Browser and go to your Google Drive.
2. Create a new folder for this project.
3. Inside the folder, create a new Google SpreadSheet for storing all the data.

### Setup Data SpreadSheet

#### Setup Schedule Sheet

1. Inside your Data SpreadSheet, name the first sheet as **Schedule** (case & order matters)

2. Put all your schedule information into **Schedule**

3. Sheet **Schedule** must have following items:
   1. a column stores date. (formatted like mm/dd or mm/dd/yyyy)
   2. a column stores sermon person name
   3. a column stores worship person name
   4. **cells at column A stores year indicator**
      * You need to input indicators for the year of schedule
      * This script uses **column A** of Sheet **Schedule** for that
      * The indicator format for this script is: **year=xxxx** where **xxxx** is 4 digit year number

#### Setup Contact Sheet

1. Inside your Data SpreadSheet, name the second sheet as **Contact** (case & order matters)

2. Sheet **Contact** must have following items:
   1. A **name** column (person's name in schedule)
   2. A **refer_name** column (how do you want to call a person in email notification)
   3. A **email** column 
   4. A **is_admin** column

3. Put all your data into dedicated columns

2. Sheet **MessagesTemplate** must formatted exactly like follow table:

| sermon_msg_doc       | url to sermon_msg_doc  |
| worship_msg_doc      | url to worship_msg_doc |

* **sermon_msg_doc** is a Google Doc that stores the template for sermon person notification (more on that in next section)
* **worship_msg_doc** is a Google Doc that stores the template for worship person notification (more on that in next section)

3. Put all your data into dedicated columns


### Setup Template Google Docs

After your finish setting up your Data SpreadSheet, your need to set up notification templates using Google Docs

1. Create two Google Docs under your project folder for sermon notification and worship notification.

2. Inside each Google Docs, type in your template notification

3. You can use following macros in your template:
   * ```${sermon_name}``` => name of sermon person
   * ```${worship_name}``` => name of worship person
   * ```${admin_name}``` => name of admins (people who have is_admin set to 1 in **Contact** Sheet)
   * ```${admin_email}``` => email of admins (people who have is_admin set to 1 in **Contact** Sheet)

4. Template example:

```
    Hello, ${sermon_name}, your are in charge of this week's sermon.
    
    If you have any question, please contact ${admin_name}.
    
    Email: ${admin_email}
```

   * **Note that, only the info of first admin in Contact Sheet will be place into templates.**

5. After you finish your template Google Docs, be sure to paste their urls to **MessagesTemplate** Sheet.

### Setup Google Apps Script

After your finish setting up both Data SpreadSheet and template Google Docs, you need to setup the Apps Script.

1. Go to your Data SpreadSheet.

2. On the top, find and click: **Extensions -> Apps Script**

3. **[OPTIONAL]** In the new tab, rename your project and current file.
   * rename project: click on the text beside "Apps Script" logo
   * rename file: click on the tree dot button from item on the left side "Files" tab

4. Copy all the contents from **autonoto.gs** file and replace them into Apps Script editor.

5. Fill in the blank for **CONFIGURATION** variable on top of the script.

```js
   // All the columns are counting start from 0 instead of 1 
   var CONFIGURATION = {
     SPREAD_SHEET_URL: "URL to Google SpreadSheet",
     SCHEDULE_SHEET: {
       RANGE: "!A:A",         // select range of Schedule Sheet
       DATE_COLUMN: 0,        // which column is for Date
       SERMON_COLUMN: 0,      // which column is for Sermon Person
       WORSHIP_COLUMN: 0      // which column is for Worship Person
     },
     CONTACT_SHEET: {
       RANGE: "!A:A",         // select range of Contact Sheet
       NAME_COLUMN: 0,        // which column is for name
       REFER_NAME_COLUMN: 0,  // which column is for refer_name
       EMAIL_COLUMN: 0,       // which column is for email
       IS_ADMIN_COLUMN: 0     // which column is for is_admin
     },
     EMAIL_SUBJECT: "Email Subject for all emails"
   }
```

6. Click on **Run** button to test the script
   * When you click on **Run** button, Google will ask your to sign in first, and then this script will ask you for some permissions (Check out [Google Apps Script Required Permissions](#google-apps-script-required-permissions) for more detail)
   * Choose an account to sign in
   * Google may give a **Google hasnâ€™t verified this app** warning message, just click **Advanced** and then **Go to your project name(unsafe)** 
   * After you reviewed all the permissions, click **Allow**.
   * You only need to do this once.


7. Finally, go to **Triggers** tab on the left side and add a trigger for your project
   * you can set when does script run after your click **Add Trigger** button.

### Testing

I suggest you set the script trigger to run at a short time first, so you can test your project. If everything works fine, you can change the trigger to what you want.
